## Introduction
This project was realized while streaming live at [https://www.twitch.tv/chrisfigge](https://www.twitch.tv/chrisfigge).
I got this piranha plant as a christmas-gift but I think it's much cooler to use it as a remote controlled gadget while streaming.
So I wrote a lot of code, printed a lot of stuff and did this electronic-thingie.
But this time with a lot of help from the mighty community.
[0FR0](https://github.com/0FR0) tried to teach me KiCad and developed my first PCB ever.
Many, many thanks, dude! Awesome job!

So you'll find everything you need to build your own remote controlled plan in here:

- BOM (everything you've to buy)
- STL files (everything to print)
- images (everything you need to watch)
- code (everything to controll your plant via wifi)
- schematics (everything to build your own circuit)


## BOM
- 1x Wemos D1 mini: [https://amzn.to/389YZPE](https://amzn.to/389YZPE) *
- 1x Nema17 Pancake: [https://amzn.to/3bYEyGN](https://amzn.to/3bYEyGN) *
- 2x 10kOhm Resistors: [https://amzn.to/3sRnLwe](https://amzn.to/3sRnLwe) *
- 1x TMC2208 (Stepperdriver): [https://amzn.to/2PzTYd1](https://amzn.to/2PzTYd1) *
- 1x IRFZ44N (Mosfet): [https://amzn.to/3kILgEA](https://amzn.to/3kILgEA) *
- 1x LM2596 (Stepdown module): [https://amzn.to/38aoLn4](https://amzn.to/38aoLn4) *

Links marked with an asterisk (*) are affiliates. This means if you order these items via amazon, i'll get a very small piece of this (financial) cake. You'll not pay more (not even 1 cent. literally nothing). And I can reinvest the money for new ideas and projects. From the community for the community. :)


## Enclosure  
If you want to print the case I've used please take a look into the "stls"-folder.  
The files are named as what they are used for.
To get a better understanding, please watch the images, stored in the "images"-folder.

## Assembly
To assemble the 3d printed parts. You will need some glue, to glue the inlay parts.
Because I'm not very good in get parts in correct position, I've printed a centering guide.
Just place the guide onto the platform and glue the "hill" nearly perfectly centered onto the baseplate. Remove the guide afterwards.

## Tip
I am doing all this stuff in my freetime. And, oh boy, these projects take a lot of time. I swear.
If you want to support my work feel free to cheer some bits or giftsubs on my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/chrisfigge) or you can always leave some tip via [paypal](https://paypal.me/flazer). Thanks a lot!
